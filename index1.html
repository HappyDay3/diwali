        1. She has and always will put up with my ridiculousness. <br>
        2. She has seen me cry, and I have seen her cry, and we are both ugly criers. <br>
        3. We can sit in silence for 20 minutes, and it’s not weird. <br>
        4. But most of the time we cannot shut up. <br>
        5. This includes three-hour phone and Skype calls about anything and everything. <br>
        6. I know what she’s going to say before she says it. <br>
        7. Eye contact is all that is needed to communicate sometimes. This definitely comes in handy when we have an opinion that shouldn’t be verbalized. <br>
        8. Even when she laughs at me, I still feel loved. <br>
        9. We find the dumbest things funny. <br>
        10. We have reoccurring jokes that normal people just find odd. <br>
